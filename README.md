# K1_Banken_Team1 
## - a console-based BankApp in C#

### General info
This BankApp is a collaborative group project developed by us during the Fullstack .NET Developer program at Chas Academy. The application simulates core banking operations and is built using object-oriented principles, .NET 8, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server LocalDB. The project follows an agile workflow guided by a prioritized backlog and iterative feedback from the teacher, who acts as the product owner. It simulates banking operations such as deposits, withdrawels, tranfers and account management. Our goal has been to learn as much as possible and work as a strong team. Our focus have been to accieve clean architecture, good user experience and maintanable code.
